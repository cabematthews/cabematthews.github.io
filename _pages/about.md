I want to see churches and individuals taking the depths of the Christian faith more seriously and more faithfully. I believe the Methodist tradition has something to offer here to the broader church.

As a pastor, I am blessed to serve at Kingwood Methodist Church, a fantastic church community in northeast Houston, Texas. Among other responsibilities, Iâ€™m the regular preaching pastor in our Vine worship community.

Most importantly, I love being married to Stephanie and being the dad to our two kids.
