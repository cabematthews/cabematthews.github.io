I am blessed to serve as a pastor at Kingwood Methodist Church, a fantastic church community in northeast Houston, Texas. Among other responsibilities, I’m the regular preaching pastor in our Vine worship community.

I am also a postgraduate research student in philosophical theology at the University of Aberdeen.

Most importantly, I love being married to Stephanie and being the dad to our two kids.
