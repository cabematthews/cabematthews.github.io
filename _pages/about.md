On the academic side, I am interested in topics in philosophical theology like freedom and grace, providence, epistemology of theology, and divine agency and action. As a pastor, I am blessed to serve on the discipleship team at The Woodlands Methodist Church. Most importantly, I love being married to Stephanie and being the dad to our two kids.
