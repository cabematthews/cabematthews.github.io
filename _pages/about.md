As a pastor, I am blessed to serve on the discipleship team at The Woodlands Methodist Church in The Woodlands, Texas. I am also interested in topics in philosophical theology like freedom and grace, providence, epistemology of theology, and divine agency and action.

In both of those areas, I want to see churches and individuals taking the depths of the Christian faith more seriously and more faithfully. I believe the Methodist tradition has something to offer here to the broader church.

Most importantly, I love being married to Stephanie and being the dad to our two kids.
