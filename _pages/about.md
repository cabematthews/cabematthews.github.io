I am interested in topics in philosophical theology like freedom and grace, providence, epistemology of theology, and divine agency and action. I love The Woodlands Methodist Church, where I am blessed to serve as a pastor on our discipleship team. Even more than that, I love being married to Stephanie and being the dad to our two kids.
