I studied Physics at The University of Texas, and I earned an MDiv from The Seattle School of Theology and Psychology. Then I took a ThM from Perkins School of Theology at Southern Methodist University. I am the Pastor of Campus Discipleship at The Woodlands Methodist Church. I'm married to Stephanie and the proud father of two.
